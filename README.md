## 📘 Project Description
This project is my **first step in Red Teaming**, focusing on understanding remote access concepts in a **safe and educational way**:  
- Simulates a **client-server communication** protocol (RAT-like behavior).  
- Demonstrates **message exchange, logging, and protocol structure**.  
- Focused on **learning, not malicious execution**.
